---  Eliminated hypothesis H129 (redundant, given H40).
---  Eliminated hypothesis H130 (redundant, given H6).
---  Eliminated hypothesis H141 (redundant, given H7).
-S-  Eliminated hypothesis H3.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of answer_count by:
          answer_count~.
<S>  New H36:  answer_count~ >= 0
<S>  New H138:  answer_count~ + numfound >= 0
<S>  New H139:  answer_count~ + numfound <= 65535
<S>  New H4:  answer_count~ <= 65471
<S>  New C3:  answer_count~ + numfound <= answer_count~ + 64
-S-  Eliminated hypothesis H5.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of current_byte by:
          start_byte + 28 * (response_counter - 1).
<S>  New H6:  start_byte + 28 * (response_counter - 1) < 8152
<S>  New H122:  numfound < response_counter + 1 or 8124 <= start_byte + 28 * (
          response_counter - 1)
<S>  New H40:  start_byte + 28 * (response_counter - 1) >= 1
-S-  Substituted hypothesis H52.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of fld_header(
          output_packet__2) by:
          fld_header(output_packet).
---  Substituted hypothesis H97, which specifies an equivalence for fld_header(
          output_packet__3).
***  Proved C3:  answer_count~ + numfound <= answer_count~ + 64
     using hypothesis H7.
***  PROVED VC.
