-S-  Eliminated hypothesis H7.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of answer_count by:
          answer_count~.
<S>  New H39:  answer_count~ >= 0
<S>  New H8:  answer_count~ <= 65471
-S-  Substituted hypothesis H55.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of fld_header(
          output_packet__2) by:
          fld_header(output_packet).
---  Substituted hypothesis H119, which specifies an equivalence for fld_header(
          output_packet__3).
***  Proved C2:  response_counter <= 63
     via its standard form, which is:
     Std.Fm C2:  - response_counter > - 64
