---  Eliminated hypothesis H162 (redundant, given H130).
---  Eliminated hypothesis H163 (redundant, given H9).
---  Eliminated hypothesis H174 (redundant, given H5).
-S-  Eliminated hypothesis H7.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of answer_count by:
          answer_count~.
<S>  New H39:  answer_count~ >= 0
<S>  New H171:  answer_count~ + num_found >= 0
<S>  New H172:  answer_count~ + num_found <= 65535
<S>  New H8:  answer_count~ <= 65471
<S>  New C3:  answer_count~ + num_found <= answer_count~ + 64
-S-  Substituted hypothesis H55.
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of fld_header(
          output_packet__2) by:
          fld_header(output_packet).
---  Substituted hypothesis H120, which specifies an equivalence for fld_header(
          output_packet__3).
***  Proved C3:  answer_count~ + num_found <= answer_count~ + 64
     using hypothesis H5.
***  PROVED VC.
