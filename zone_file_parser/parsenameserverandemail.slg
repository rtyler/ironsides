-S-  Applied substitution rule parsenameser_rules(70).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of 
          rr_type__domainnamestringtypeindex__last by:
          128.
<S>  New H13:  loop__3__i <= 128
***  Proved C5:  endidx + 1 <= zlength
     via its standard form, which is:
     Std.Fm C5:  - endidx + zlength > 0
     using hypothesis H17.
